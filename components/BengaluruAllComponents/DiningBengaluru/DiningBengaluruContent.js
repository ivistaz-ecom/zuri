                        Journey into a world of myriad cuisines, when you dine at one of our restaurants, whose reputation of dishing out variety and surprises in equal doses is not without reason. Whether it is our all day multi-cuisine restaurant Karibu, or our authentic Italian restaurant Incanto, the Pan Asian Lounge Sake, or the Alfresco poolside bar and Indian restaurant Infinity, the only problem youâ€™ll ever face is deciding where to eat, what and when. How much, will never be a problem, because you might never stop.
