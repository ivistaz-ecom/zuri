                        Celebrated in August and September, Onam is a big deal not only in Kumarakom but all over Kerala. The interesting thing about Onam is that it is not a religious festival; which is why everyone, irrespective of caste and creed celebrates it, for it is a celebration of the land. Boat races and musical performances perfectly encapsulate the festive spirit. Indulge yourself into ‘Onam Sadya’, the traditional meal on this auspicious day, rounds off the festival.
