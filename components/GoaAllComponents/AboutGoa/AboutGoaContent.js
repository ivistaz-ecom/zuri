                    <p>
                        The ideal time to visit Goa would be immediately after summer, when the temperatures are relatively moderate. During the winter season, starting from November and going all the way to March, you will experience a much cooler GOA.

                        The Arabian Sea in this part of the country is a lot calmer, making it possible for tourists to enjoy water-sports or simply a dip in the ocean. Goa’s tour packages, suitable for every budget, are tailored to give you the most quintessential Goan experience.

                    <p>
                        The traditional fish curry with rice might be the most recognizable Goan cuisine, but that is just the tip of the culinary iceberg. One visit to Goa might not be enough to sample everything it has to offer. Exotic curries like Ambot-tik (shark cooked in a red sauce with spices) to Sorpotel (fiery pork cooked in a clay pot on firewood) jostle for popularity amongst visitors and tourists here. Goan cuisines is tasty, flavourful and unique.
