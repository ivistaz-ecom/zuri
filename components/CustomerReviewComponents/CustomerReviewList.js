The beautiful beach was only a 3 to 4 minute stroll from the Hotel and when we got there virtually deserted apart from the odd cow. All the trips we made were organized by the hotel and all went with out a hitch with plenty to do in and around the area - this was possibly the best holiday we have enjoyed and we will without doubt return for round two.",

Landscaping and architecture is splendid! Staffs are most cordial and their welcome was mind blowing! We enjoyed amenities and services like paddle boat, rafting, cycling, fishing, swimming pool, steam bath, sauna etc which were free. One thing not to miss is the sunset view with complimentary tea/coffee! The view of house boats in the backdrop of setting sun is really fantabulous! As the food (ala- carte) is expensive, we opted for buffet option for lunch and dinner. Buffet spread is decent. Mutton and beef dishes were really yum! Areas to improve: Informed the manager about the need for in-room amenities like AC and TV which required service/ replacement. We were guaranteed about immediate service. (Not considering it a serious issue as we thoroughly enjoyed the stay and collected a life time of good memories!) FIVE STARS!",

The biggest turn down is food.... The food spread was so bad that on the second day night we had food from outside the resort. Apart from food everything else is excellent.",

The rooms are family big and with all the facilities of any star resort. The approach road is very small. Which can be a problem for big vehicles. Any time other than the summer will be perfect for a leisure trip.",

We were greeted with warm wet towels and fresh coconut water followed by a visit of property by the courteous staff. The spa and swimming pool were amazing. Buffet breakfast as well as a la carte dinner were phenomenal, being a north Indian I was pretty happy with the north Indian food they served. The cottage rooms were spacious and had a great view of the lagoon, bathroom was quite huge and comfortable. M truly glad we chose Zuri and nothing else for our holiday.",
