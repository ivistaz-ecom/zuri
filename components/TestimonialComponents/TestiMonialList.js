Rohan of course will probably be one of the most enthusiastic guests to have enjoyed boating in the beautiful lake on multiple occasions. And I took in the sights and sounds of the property on many of my leisurely walks. Not to forget the lovely spread at breakfast and dinner and of course the evening coffee by the lakeside. Our Kerala sojourn comes to an end, but we take back with us beautiful memories of the time spent at The Zuri Kumarakom. Looking forward to many more such memorable visits in the future."',
